            I write about software and anything that comes along with it. The pictures are just there cause I like them!
            I write about software <strong class="highlight">to publicly challenge what I think I know</strong> . I'm also hoping these posts help others on their coding journey.
            It's not enough to know, I'd like to be able to teach. Afterall software is amazing and it continues to keep me in awe.
            Why should only the few know it?

        Arriving at Spredfast I challenged myself to tackle on problems outside of my comfort zone. This lead me to <strong class="highlight">fix security issues</strong>, implement a way for
        users to successfully log out of our platform, <strong class="highlight">write a faster test suite</strong>, and take on core complex problems.
        I support my team by building features in either <strong class="highlight">Ruby</strong> or <strong class="highlight">JavaScript</strong>.
        I am able to adapt to my teams needs and am always <strong class="highlight">eager to learn more</strong>.

          Connecting graduates with job openning is a daunting task. The Recruit App is a repository of companies, job opennings, and graduates currently looking for a new job.
          Built on <strong class="highlight">Rails</strong> the app allows students to create profiles to manage their <a href="https://recruit.makersquare.com/?v=kkohashigawa2" target="_blank">online profile</a>.
          Team members of career services can quickly query through users, company and positions. Search uses <strong class="highlight">Backbone</strong> to filter and drill down to specific profiles.

        SureUp is a platform which connects people with dozens of independent car insurance companies. Algorithms calculate which insurance policies to best
        fit a person's financial and liablity needs in matter of minutes. Calculations are made based on information from multiple vendor APISs. Calculations need to be fast
        accurate and testable. It is built using <strong class="highlight">Rails</strong>, <strong class="highlight">Backbone</strong>, and leverages <strong class="highlight">Redis</strong> for caching API responses.

      <h3>Breathe Team</h3>
      <p>
        I love testing what I think I know. What better way doing just that than <strong class="highlight">mentoring</strong>!? I have been mentoring MakerSquare students since November 2013.
        Along the way I found many students missing out on core concepts. In response I created Breathe Team. The inspiration came after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFC16ptx-0" target="_blank">Eric Thomas' mantra</a>.
        <em>When you want to succed as bad as you want to breathe then you will be successful.</em>
        The team meets every Friday at 4:30pm rain or shine!

        I suck at it so don't ask me anything yet. Still tons of fun even if I ride my brakes from the car and back!

      <h3><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Photography</h3>
      <p>
        Before programming I was a wedding photographer. I still enjoy photography hence the photos with the blog posts. The lack of photos on this site makes me a sad panda, so I think I'll get back into it!
